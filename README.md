# bgt includeable package

this is all the bgt classes and functions I have made, edited, or modified. while using all of these, you can report any of the bugs or rong functions to me If you found any.

please note: all of these might update from time to time when we have a new idea with a new script.

each class of function has a folder, inside the folder you can found the code for it, and readme in some classes and functions. also some scripts contain examples and helps inside the codes, while some scripts are not.
all of these scripts might not be the best things, however I think you might need for your games sometimes.
